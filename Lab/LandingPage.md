> _Note: This documentation is work in progress now._

Watson Assistant consists of a reasoning engine and a set of domain agents. Agents can be programmed and directly executed using this lab. 

As you begin your agent development, you may want to familarize yourself with the [components](Components.md) necessary for building an agent, as well as with [development lab](DevelopmentLab.md) that is used to program them. Additionally, our team has created a set of useful [tutorials](Tutorials.md) to help you get started.
