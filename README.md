## This is *not* a chatbot. This is EBA.

Business Assistant ... Digital Twin ... Business Process AI ... whatever you call it by, engineers need the best techniques in order to bring valuable AI to their customers.  EBA presents a unique and proven model based on modern, patent-pending, approach to machine reasoning.

The Embedded Business AI (“EBA”) framework is an omni-channel, enterprise-class, digital AI framework used by developers to enable advanced domain-specific business process use cases for end-users. Unlike other dialog management systems that use rule-based reasoning and predicate logic, with EBA you describe your business domain to the machine in a simple, consistent, complete and straightforward way. Dialog (whether human:machine or machine:machine interaction) are simply inputs to and outputs from the reasoning core. In other words: this isn't a chatbot.

## What can you do with EBA?

In the video below, see how IBM used EBA to create an omni-present "digital twin" for marketing professionals that supports its human counterpart wherever she may conduct business.

We also have sample agents for other domains, like Supply Chain, within the [dev lab](https://eba.ibm.com/assistant#/lab) for you to dig into.
