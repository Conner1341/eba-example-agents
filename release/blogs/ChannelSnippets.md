## Channel Snippets

EBA provides a number of integration capabilties. Currently, we support EBA as an application in its own right within Slack as well as Watson Workspace. In these external channels, EBA is able to automatically create screenshots and live snippets for richer visualization experience. Such interactive content is now seamlessly served within SCI Resolution Rooms (fka Watson Workspace). This feature serves as a good example of how EBA powered data can be delivered across various channels leveraging their unique features. You can think about EBA content embedding into web pages, conversational systems, presentations, e-mails, sharing information with peers or publishing it to public.
