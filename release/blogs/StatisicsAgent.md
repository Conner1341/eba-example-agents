## Statisitical agent

We have enabled our statisical agent to be generally available and compabtible with all domains. Given a domain entity with attributes ontology in place, EBA will be able to answer statisical questions regarding its various data points. The main statisical insights this agent provides are:

* average/minimum/maximum value of an attribute
* values distribution of an attribute
* relationship between attributes
* transformation of arbitrary collection to the tabular representation (dataset)
