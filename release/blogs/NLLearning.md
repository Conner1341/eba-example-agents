## NL based clarification learning

In preview mode, it is now possible to train EBA to understand new words or phrases by simply explaining the meaning using natural language only. Given the correct explanation EBA will create all the necessary  natural language patterns, concepts and semantic actions automatically. This mode is learning is useful to business practioners, who may not understand to the techincal aspects of their assistant, but would like to clarify their intentions using an interface familar to everyone--natural langauge. Below is an example of this learning in action.

EBA is transparent about the parts of your question which it does not understand, as it is noted by an underlining. In the example above, the term 'hot' was not understand. By clicking the 'Train Watson' icon beneath your question, you can explain to EBA what exactly you meant by this term. Here 'hot' denotes top 5 mailings sorted by click rate. By simply rephrasing your statement in a more precise way, Watson is able to recognize and reuse new terms going forward. This custom training will follow you as a user, and it has no affect on others. 

Such custom training can be viewed within our system as a kind of custom training _experience_ for your assistant. If at anytime, you wish to view all your custom experience or else to even delete it. You simply request, in natural language, 'show me my experience' or 'remove my experience', respectively.
