## Execution Workflow

As an new AI technology, EBA strives to abide by certain principles of transparency. We want EBA to be an open box; and we quite adamantly and intentionally provide interospection tools across our application. Along these lines, EBA has a released a new UI feature detailing the execution workflow of a particular question. This execution workflow provides a sequential timeline of our execution pipeline. At each step in the pipeline, you are able to find relevant information such as the actions invoked and their respective timings.
