Fallback style agents are agents which can handle questions if no matching Semantic API is found. So you can search knowledge base, describe what your agents can do, call other systems and etc.
Fallback style agents can leverage partial reasoning data like in the sample above “tel me about” was identified as “show me” intent and it was removed from Wikipedia search query to improve search result relevance.

To get the most out of this sample, please load the [yaml configuration](./Wikipedia.yaml) into your own sandbox enviornment.
