The developement lab was created in an effort to enable an open system of Watson Assistant skill developers. Using the lab tools, developers can write skills to extend Watson Assistant to their organizational and personal needs. This document contains an overview of the various features and components of the lab.

The development lab is organized into one [control bar](./ControlBar.md) and 8 tabs, viz. [general](./General.md), [concepts](./Concepts.md), [patterns](./Patterns.md), [actions](./Actions.md), [rules](./Rules.md), [assets](./Assets.md), [explore](./LabExplore.md), and [debug](./Debug.md)
