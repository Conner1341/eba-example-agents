### Global Functions and Objects

##### Global Functions

EBA provides global (render) functions which are available for frontend assets. A subset of common used functions are listed here:
 - `renderText(field)` -- used to render a non-String based value (Number, Date) as text, e.g. `renderText(123)` => `'123.0'` 
 - `renderBoolean(field)` -- renders the boolean value based on the user's locale, e.g. with `locale: de_DE` => `renderBoolean(true)` => `'wahr'`
 - `renderDecimal(field)` -- renders the number value based on the user's locale, e.g. `locale: de_DE` => `renderDecimal(17.34)` => `'17,34'`
 - `renderPercent(field)` -- renders the percent value based on the user's locale, e.g. `locale: de_DE` => `renderPercent(0.344)` => `'34,4%'`
 - `renderCurrency(field)` -- renders the currency value based on the user's locale, e.g. `locale: de_DE` => `renderCurrency(17.34)` => `'17.34 EUR'`
 - `renderDate(field)` -- renders the date value based on the user's locale, e.g. `locale: fr_FR` => `renderDate(1549369035501)` => `'5 f√©vrier 2019'`
 - `renderDuration(field)` -- renders the duration value based on the user's locale. TODO @kevingrozav: Example for duration???

##### Global Objects

EBA provides a set of global objects which are available for frontend assets.

 - `bridge` TODO @kevingrozav. Please provide more details for the bridge object.
    - `.trigger(action, question)` -- triggers an event to ask Watson Assistant a question,   
    e.g. `bridge.trigger('ask', 'Tell me a joke')` will execute the question `Tell me a joke` in the EBA reasoning pipeline.

 - TODO @kevingrozav: do we have others?


### Native UI Components
Our team provides users with a few pre-built and configurable react components that are generic across any application domain. We intend the detail these components and their usage within this document. 

In particular, we support the following components:
 - [List](./frontend/React_Lists.md)
 - [Table](./frontend/React_Tables.md)
 - [Props](./frontend/React_Props.md)
