## Training tab

EBA allows an agent to be trained in order to be able to answer natural language questions which are not covered by NL patterns.

### Examples table

In this table you can provide training examples. The table has three columns:

1. Question - a question you want EBA to understand;
2. Explanation - an explanation of a question from the column #1 (an alternative way to ask a question which EBA can understand);
3. Context - for certain questions you may need some data to be in the context. You can put natural langauge question which produces the necessary context in this column.

All the information provided in samples table is in form of natural language text. The training process is end-to-end training which means you don't need to craft NL patterns, actions or rules. EBA will automatically generate all the necessary components.
