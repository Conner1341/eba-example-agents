## NLU best practices

EBA represents a paradigm shift in the way conversational AI is implemented for businesses. It is not based on intent-classification or ownership of a particular question among multiple agents. The system is designed to be collaborative, where multiple agents work together to produce understanding and meaningful assistance. Free collaboration will always imply that one agent can introduce side effects across the total environment. For instance, our [Riddle agent](../../Riddles.md) can entirely take over a conversation--by design, of course. The implication for developers is that a particular agent should follow a set of best practices to avoid introducing unwanted interference to their NLU pipeline. To this end, we provide a list of areas where best practices should be carefully considered:

* [Conceptual semantics](#correct-semantics)
* [Implicit knowledge](#implicit-knowledge)
* [Extending core functionality](#extending-core-functionality)
* [Atomic actions](#atomic-actions)

### Correct semantics

Every agent loaded into an environment is invoked in an effort to provide understanding of natural language for its particular domain. In other words, each agent will provide a set of annotations to introduce conceptual knowledge into the system. Consequently, developers should be careful to introduce conceptual knowledge that actually makes sense, i.e. conveys the correct semantics. Consider this NL pattern and its directive to the system:

* `when was this order [delivered](example:DeliveryDate)`

In the first pattern, the intention of the developer is to support questions requesting the delivery date of some business entity such as an order or a shipment. However, this pattern introduces a side effect to the system. Anytime the word 'delivered' occurs in a similar usage, it _must_ be considered as potentially a reference to some delivery date. This means that when we reason about questions such as 'the package was delivered', 'we delivered the software update', or 'show me the delivered goods', the system must consider all possible ways in which it can potentially resolve a _delivery date_. Clearly this represents an unwanted performance overhead for such questions which have nothing to do with dates. One could argue that this pattern is _prima facie_ itself. `example:DeliveryDate` is an date attribute, but there is no notion of _date_ expressed in the pattern, only the notion of _delivered_. The word 'delivered' can signify a multitude of things, and it should be considered as an aggressive move to annotate all references as a tied to some _date_. The developer's original intention can be better served here by encoding some more context. What the developer truly means to capture is that an inquisition like 'when' along with the notion of 'delivered' can be treated as a request to show a delivery date. For instance, the question 'when will the order be delivered?' clearly stands as a request for the delivery date. A simple adjustment to the pattern allows it to be rewritten as `[when](example:DeliveryDate) was this order [delivered](example:DeliveryDate)` can prevent all of these side effects and convey the correct and intended semantics. A rewriting rule can also serve as an option for this case.

### Implicit knowledge

We must accept that conversation in general is often unqualified and implicit. Any true AI must be able to cope with this and understand implicit connections between different conceptual entities. To this end, EBA provides multiple mechanisms for capturing implicit knowledge within your agent. However such mechanisms can be abused and, in some cases, even result in performance issues. In the case of rewriting rules and certain actions, EBA allows developers to idenify a set of higher level concepts into a set of lower level concepts. The ability to create or invent new concepts which do not exist within NL itself is a powerful capability, and, for this reason, we provide a penalty score for such created concepts in our scoring model. Consider the following rewriting rule: 

* `TimeframeWithFilter: a subClassOf :Showable => a(:Timeframe) -> :Filter(:Timeframe)`

This rule states that everytime any showable entity is referenced in NL along with a timeframe, an additional `:Filter` concept should be introduced. This leads to performance and scoring side effect.

The performance side effect is that within a single question, there may be multiple showable entities and for each of these showable entities, we will consider how to make use of some filter operation. For agents focused on data retrival and KPI support, the marjoity of its actions will expose a filter. This can lead to quite a substantive search at reasoning time. Furthermore, this rewriting rules violates [conceptual semantics](#correct-semantics), as it is a wrong and aggressive assumption that every time a showable entity and a timeframe occurs within a question that a filter must be applied. For instance, in the question 'show me my appointment for this Thursday', we are fetching a singular entity and there is no collection or filter involved. Of course, this can lead to a performance overhead for such questions which do not fit this use case at all.

The scoring side effect is that, since `:Timeframe` occurs on both LHS and RHS, this concept can be used both in the production of a new concept via this rule as well as by a separate action. Additionally the `:Filter` concept will inherit the score of the root node used to create it, viz. some showable entity. Such entities typically hold higher score as they can span multiple tokens, and, furthermore, there POS tag is that of nouns, which hold the highest score in our model. 

### Extending core functionality

While we enable developers to extend core functionality in cases where it makes sense, it requires caution. There is a fine line after all between _extending_ core functionality and _overriding_ core functionality. The latter will almost certainly lead to poor NLU. Our team has provided some safe guards to warn users about potentially overriding core functionality within NL patterns. Consider the following pattern:

* `[are there](:ActionShow) any orders with shipment number [matching](:Equivalent) "__"`

This pattern is an example of overriding core functionality, insofar as ambigutation is introduced in the place where exisitng functionality would otherwise be clear and expected. For instance, consider the annotaiton `[are there](:ActionShow)`. EBA intentionally distinguishes between existential questions (via `:IsThere`) and requests to show data (via `:ActionShow`). This annotation confuses the two, which leads to additional complexity as well as to potential system disambiguation follow ups. The difference between a chat bot and AI is that AI should actually understand, in a fine grained way, what is being asked. Forcing all types of interactions to be show requests, on the other hand, intimates that, in a contrived effort, one is seeking to build the former rather than the later. Additionally, consider the annotation `[matching](:Equivalent)`. In EBA core, `:Equivalent` denotes strict equivalence and is reserverd for NL triggers like 'equal to', 'equivalent', 'is', '=' etc. EBA also supports a fuzzy search via the concept `:Like`. 'Match' is more aligned with the latter rather than the former, but this annotation blurs this line across the system. Note that if there is ever a doubt about what concepts our core agents supports and their expected usage, we have exposed their implementation, including patterns and action signatures, to all users within the dev lab. 

### Atomic actions

Within EBA, actions are composed of two components, viz. conceptual signatures and exection logic. It is particularly important to think of actions with respect the first component. Actions represent conceptual signatures which allow your assistant to reason about actionable outcomes when resolving a particular question. We allow for a degree of polymorphism within actions. This enables reusable functionality across the same of class of entities, but, like other convenience features, it too can be abused. Actions were are highly polymorphic can lead to unpredicatable runtime behavior as they are given permission to consume many concepts within a question. Regarding these signatures, there is a golden rule which should be followed--actions should be atomic in the functionality they provide. An action should not _both_ fetch unqualified entities as well as search against this entity for a subset. Following this rule allows the system to have atomic predictable building blocks when reasoning. To illustrate these points, consider the following action:

```
name:
example:GetObjectById

constraint:
object subClassOf example:Object, field subClassOf example:Field

input:
object (optional field (optional example:Identifier (data :UserString)))

output:
data object
```

Based on the provided name, you would expect this action to do one thing--to fetch an object by its id. However, a close look at the signature reveals that it _optionally_ can take any given field and indentifier to perform data filtering. This action is clearly not atomic. Furthermore, the constraints are loosely provided, it allows any object and any field but does not necessarily contrain this field to belong to this object. Because these contraints are so loose, we can reasonably expect that, in the course of reasoning, this action can be used to consume some attribute for some entity in some unexpected way. Decomposing this action into two atomic pieces, removing hidden optional functionality, and providing more substantive contraints will lead to a much more predictable behavior at reasoning time.
