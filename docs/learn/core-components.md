## Core components

There are five core components that constitute a skill. Before you begin building your own agent, you should familiarize yourself with these components. It is also important to note that EBA follows an ontology-based paradigm, which is in contrast to most other systems that are intent-based and depend on predicate logic.

At a high level, EBA is composed of an _ontology_ of concepts and _attributes_ that it is able to recognize and reason about. Natural language _patterns_ help EBA achieve natural language understanding, linking language tokens to appropriate concepts. While reasoning about a query, EBA considers all possible outcomes that it can take, given a set of _actions_ and _rules_, ultimately selecting the best one or asking for clarification where needed. Learn more about each of these components at the following links:
