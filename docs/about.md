## Why EBA?

Chat bots have proven incapable of handling the breadth and complexity of language, tasks, and processes in the workplace. If you’ve experienced the frustration of trying to train a standard chat bot to be contextually aware or to execute tasks across business domains and multiple channels, EBA may prove to be a better solution for your AI use case pattern engineering.
 
### Experience
The engineering team behind EBA has a combined 40 years in active AI development, including half of that time spent specifically on machine reasoning. We are well versed in many theoretical and practical machine reasoning designs including basic rules, case-based, blackboard, and PRS. (some tenets of PRS have proven valuable). You can rely on a team that is constantly analyzing leading edge movements in reasoning techniques - all for your benefit. You concentrate on the use cases that will bring customer value, EBA has your back.

### Environment
EBA was built for developers, by developers. We’ve taken (and will continue to take) as much complexity out of crafting, designing, presenting, connecting, managing, and deploying skills within the AI environment. This includes a development experience embedded in EBA itself, complete with automated deployment of change sets, native inclusion of core AI functions and business skills, as well as debugging tools. It is multi-active, multi-regional, employs zero-ops autonomics… EBA is resilient. All of this is available to you immediately after login. EBA already works beautifully on mobile, desktop, native app (Mac), Slack, and Watson Workspace and is ready to engage your customers wherever they are. EBA accommodates your organization’s needs, not the other way around.

### Evolution
Those of you who have worked on intent-based chat bots know how easy it is to get started crafting dialog flows and mapping outcomes to a function. You also know that getting to the next hill of advanced multi-domain AI response/resolution is nearly impossible given the fragile nature of rule-based intent classification. With EBA, you will teach the reasoning machine your business domain through conceptual design, you describe a handful of access patterns, you connect your physical sources that fulfill the conceptual model, and you focus on the outcome for your customer. Humans love to break things… do you want to write a “Choose your own Adventure” single-use novel with fixed transitions or do you want to craft the open experience of the HHGTTG?

## EBA construction ##

EBA borrows from many well-established machine reasoning techniques dating back to the 1980s and later. We’ve attracted a core group of engineers that have taken these concepts and greatly expanded on them through elegant functional design. In fact, EBA’s core was built using Haskell. Domain-agent extensions can be written in any language thanks to IBM Cloud Functions and the integration we’ve crafted to bridge other runtimes with our reasoning core.

Please visit [Programming EBA](docs/LandingPage.md) for more information about EBA construction and building extensions using our sample agents included in this repository.
